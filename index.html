			<h2>The Musician</h2>
			<p class="content">I started playing the guitar when I was fourteen. I began to study music theory
				and I have been avidly learning new things about music every day. I also have experience playing
				ukulele, banjo, piano, and percussion instruments. I partake in clubs such as the RIT ukulele club
				and the RIT jam club. In these clubs I have been able to learn and teach 
				musical styles spanning various play styles and genres.
			</p>
			<h2>Skills</h2>

				using languages such as MySQL and MongoDB. I also built this site using HTML/CSS.
